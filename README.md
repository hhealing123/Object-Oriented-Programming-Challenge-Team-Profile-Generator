# Object-Oriented Programming Challenge: Team Profile Generator

## Description
This week's challenge is to build a `Node.js command-line application` that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Since testing is key to making code maintainable, you will also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them. 

Note that this application will not be deployed; hence, a walkthrough of project that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing will be needed.

## User Story
```
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
```

## Installation & Usage & Tests
Type `npm install` in the terminal to install this project, then type `node index.js`.

This project is used to demonstrate `Object Oriented Programming (OOP)` using `Node.js`. The main purpose of this project is to utilize `Testing Driven Development`.

Type `npm run test` in the terminal to test codes.

## Project Demonstration

## Final Thoughts
By far I think this week's assignment was hardest compared to other week's assignments simply because I am not really familiar with using test driven development. In addition, I have encountered numerous errors when creating this project which mainly came from connecting and constructing functions. Although it was very challenging to complete this project, I definetely learned a lot and was quite fun solving issues that I had, such as putting missing pieces together, connect, and export/import modules.
